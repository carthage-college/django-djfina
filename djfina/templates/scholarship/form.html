                <p>
                    We encourage students to apply for as many private scholarships as possible. Whenever the Office
                    of Student Financial Planning (OSFP) is informed of a scholarship, we send information about that 
                    scholarship out to the students through the Carthage email. In addition, we keep a scholarship book at the 
                    front desk in our office that can be reviewed at any time. Lists of private scholarship websites 
                    are available on the Financial Aid web site as well as at our front desk. We encourage students also 
                    to investigate the scholarships available through the different departments or courses offered at 
                    Carthage
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should the student be awarded a private scholarship, Carthage requires the student to provide a copy 
                    of the private scholarship documentation to the Office of Student Financial Planning annually. Once 
                    we have received the Private Scholarship Notification Form and a copy of the scholarship notification 
                    letter, we will add the scholarship amount to the student's financial aid award. The student is 
                    responsible for making sure any and all requirements of the scholarship donor are met and that these 
                    funds are disbursed to Carthage College
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have received notification that you will be receiving a Private Scholarship, please complete the 
                    below information and return to the above address. <b>YOU MUST ATTACH</b> a copy of the 
                    documentation received from the donor for each of the scholarships awarded. <b>Without this 
                    documentation, we cannot add this scholarship to your financial aid award.</b> If you have any 
                    questions, don't hesitate to contact the OSFP at 262-551-6001
